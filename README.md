This is the final project with unit test and instrumentation test for the android part and phpunit test for the back-end since we used php to connect the mysqlserver to the android.
the phpunit test is found in the phpunitbackendtest folder whereas the unit test for the andoid part is found in the app/src/test and the instrumentational test for the android part also found in app/src/androidtest.
Both the instrumentation and the unit test for the android part used two different frame work for testing
The unit test for andoid part is done using the mockito frame work whereas the instrumentational test for android part is done using espresso frame work.
generally we did it for more classes of our project and we did different tests for one single class or done both instrumentational  and unit test depending on the classes situation.
